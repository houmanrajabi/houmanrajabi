# Hello. I am Houman.

I am a curious builder **about the systems that govern our world**.

My work centers on **deciphering** the noise of the information age. I look for the patterns to create systems that clarify rather than clutter. Whether shaping an insight, orchestrating AI agents or designing new tools, I'm trying to apply **the art of selection and placement**: finding the right components and arranging them into a coherent whole.

### Current Exploration
*I follow my curiosity. Right now, I am working on:*

> **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
> *Grounding Large Language Models in reality to reduce hallucination and increase utility.*
>
> 📂 **The Code:** [Link to Repository](https://github.com/houmanrajabi/)
>
> **An Open Invitation.**
> This project is a work in progress, and I value the "wisdom of the crowd." If you explore the code and see a way to optimize the logic or a flaw in the design, I am eager to hear your thoughts. Your feedback helps turn good code into great systems.

### Dialogue
I believe that innovation happens at the intersection of different perspectives. If you are **charting** similar complexities or simply want to discuss the future of these technologies, I am always open to **exchanging ideas**.
