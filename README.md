## Hello. I am Houman.

I am a curious **tinkerer** trying to understand the systems that govern our world.

My work centers on **deciphering** the noise of the information age. I look for the patterns to create systems that clarify rather than clutter. Whether shaping an insight, orchestrating AI agents or designing new tools, I'm trying to apply **the art of selection and placement**: finding the right components and arranging them into a coherent whole.

### Current Exploration
*I follow my curiosity. Right now, I am working on:*

> **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
> *Grounding Large Language Models in reality to reduce hallucination and increase utility.*
>
> 📂 **The Code:** [Link to Repository](https://github.com/houmanrajabi/)
>
> **An Open Invitation.**
> This project is a work in progress, and I value the "wisdom of the crowd." we have seen code grows best when shared. I have set up the logic, but I am looking for fresh eyes to help refine the flow. If you have a moment to glance through the repository, I would love to know what you see. Is there a smoother path? A bottleneck I missed? Let’s refine this together.
